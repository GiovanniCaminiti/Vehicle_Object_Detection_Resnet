# Vehicle_Object_Detection_Resnet
Object detection project developed for a university Deep Learning course. The pipeline uses PyTorch and a ResNet backbone to detect multiple vehicle classes in the Vehicles-OpenImages dataset. The repository includes data preparation scripts, training notebooks, model evaluation, and a comparison between a pre-trained model and a fine-tuned version
